            <h4><b>Sentence Diagramming</b></h4>
            <p> Most methods of diagramming in pedagogy originated from the work of Alonzo Reed and Brainerd Kellogg in the late 1800â€™s.
                Instead of looking into the order of words, Reed-Kellogg diagrams took a different approach in that they focused more on
                how words function within a sentence and how they relate to each other. Sentence diagrams have stemmed from this approach
                and are now widely used by many to pictorially represent the grammatical structure of a sentence.
                They allow us to gain a better understanding of the relationship between words and the nature of syntactic structure.
                Diagramming sentences is also an effective method for creating more complex sentences.
                Sentence diagrams are used by teachers as a precise method of teaching grammar to students but can also be extremely beneficial
                to people trying to learn the English language. </p>

                    <h4><b>The English Language</b></h4>
                        <p>There are approximately 390 million native English speakers worldwide, moreover there are almost double the amount people who speak English as a second language. Depending on the
                            criterion chosen, the total number of people who speak English of some kind is said to be towards 2 billion!<br><br>
                            The interactive graph  <i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-md infoTooltip"><span class="infoTooltiptext">Hover over the bars in the chart for more accurate data.<br>
                            Clicking a legend eliminates its associated data from the chart allowing for a more specific comparison.</span></i> demonstrates how English compares against other languages in terms
                            of native speakers, second language speakers, and a total of the two. The data was retrieved from the 19th edition of Ethnolougue, a language reference published by
                            SIL International. From the graph it can be seen that English ranks third in native speakers. Unsurprisingly it can also be seen that there a more people that speak English
                            as a second language than any other language. These statistics outline the importance of pedagogical approaches that assist people in learning the English language.</p>

                <h4><b>Parts Of Speech</b></h4>
                <p>Every word in the English language belongs to one of eight word groups or <b><i>parts of
                    speech</i></b>.
                    Below is a brief summary of each group and how each can be represented within a sentence diagram.
                </p>
                <div class="well noun">
                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Nouns</b></h4>
                    <p>A noun denotes a person, place, animal, thing or idea. Nouns can perform a variety of jobs in sentences.
                    They can act as subjects, direct and indirect objects, predicate nouns, and more!<br>
                    Examples: John, Harvard, dog, computer, concept.</p>
                    <blockquote><u>John</u> walked the <u>dog</u>.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote><u>Harvard</u> is located in <u>Cambridge</u>, <u>Massachusetts</u>.</blockquote>

                </div>
                <div class="well pronoun">
                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Pronouns</b></h4>
                    <p>A pronoun is a word that takes the place of one or more nouns. Pronouns can do everything that nouns can do and
                        therefore can perform a variety of jobs in sentences also.
                        There are three types of pronouns: <b>object</b> (for example, him); <b>possessive</b> (for example, his); or <b>subject</b> (for example, he).<br>
                        Examples: I, me, you, he, she, they, we.</p>
                    <blockquote>John saw <u>his friend</u>, and <u>he</u> waved at <u>him</u>.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote><u>She</u> said that <u>it</u> is cold outside.</blockquote>
                </div>
                <div class="well adjective">
                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Adjectives</b></h4>
                    <p>An adjective describes a noun or pronoun. They are words that describe or modify other words, making the English language a lot more interesting.
                        Sentences can contain multiple adjectives. <br>
                        Examples: the, special, blue, bright, colorful.</p>
                    <blockquote><u>The</u> <u>blue</u> car is John's.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>She would like <u>the</u> <u>fresh</u> cake.</blockquote>
                </div>
                <div class="well verb">
                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Verbs</b></h4>
                    <p>A verb describes an action or a state of being. In English, a sentence or question cannot be made without a verb,
                        this outlines the importance of these "action" parts of speech. Verbs always express activity.<br>
                        Examples: cut, walk, run, swim, play, eat.</p>
                    <blockquote>The baker <u>cut</u> the bread precisely. (<i>action verb</i>)</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>The bread <u>is</u> good. (<i>linking verb</i>)</blockquote>
                </div>
                <div class="well adverb">
                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Adverbs</b></h4>
                    <p>An adverb is a word or phrase that describes a verb, adjective, or other adverbs. Adverbs perform a variety of functions in sentences.<br>
                        Examples: very, rapidly, so, lazily, honestly.</p>
                    <blockquote>The boy answered the question <u>honestly</u>.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>She completed the task <u>very</u> <u>quickly</u>.</blockquote>
                </div>
                <div class="well preposition">
                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Prepositions</b></h4>
                    <p>A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a noun or a pronoun and some other word or element in the rest of the sentence.
                        Prepositions occur in prepositional phrases: (a preposition + a noun or pronoun). These prepositional phrases act as adjectives or adverbs.<br>
                        Examples: in, up, on, into, from, above, below.</p>
                    <blockquote>John received a gift <u>from</u> Jill.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>School finishes <u>on</u> Friday.</blockquote>

                <div class="well conjunction">
                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Conjunctions</b></h4>
                    <p>A conjunction is a part of speech that is used to connect words, clauses, phrases, or sentences.
                        There are multiple different types of conjunctions that perform various different tasks within sentence structures.<br>
                        <b>Coordinating conjunctions</b> join two or more words, clauses, sentences, or other parts of speech with equal syntactic importance.<br>
                        Examples: and, or, for, yet, but<br>
                        <b>Subordinating conjunctions</b> join dependant clauses with independent clauses.<br>
                        Examples: because, although, since.</p>
                    <blockquote>Tom went to the zoo <u>and</u> to the cinema on Saturday.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>The girl got good grades <u>because</u> she studied everyday.</blockquote>

                    <h4 class="partsOfSpeech"><b>Interjections</b></h4>
                    <p>Interjections are words or phrases that show emotion. They are not grammatically related to the rest of sentence. <br>
                        Examples: yeah, oh no, phew, ahh, eww</p>
                    <blockquote><u>Oh no</u>, he crashed the car!</blockquote>

                <h4><b>Diagram parts</b></h4>
                <p>There are a variety of primitives that can be combined to form the structural aspect of a sentence diagram. The examples on the <a href="#view"><b>display page</b></a> demonstrate how these
                    primitives can be used when diagramming a sentence. Below is a description of a selection of these primitives:

                        <div class="col-md-9"><p><b>Subject-Verb relationship: </b>This primitive is used to represent the subject and verb of a sentence. The subject is placed to the left of the middle divider
                        and the verb to the right. In order to be complete, a sentence must contain a verb, and a verb must act on a subject so this primitive can be considered the core component of every diagram with

                        <p><b>Diagram:</b></p>
                        <img src="/images/complexDiagram.png" class="img-fluid center-block complexExample" alt="Complex example">
                        <p>The diagram above is an example of how a compound sentence is diagrammed. If we look at the grammatical components of the diagram, it can be seen that there are multiple subjects
                        and verbs. Dotted lines are used within sentence diagrams to represent conjunctions. The tripod-like primitive can be used when diagramming complex sentences.</p>
